                                            anniversary, all these memories of him talking about my wedding “someday”,
                                            keep coming back to me. He had a lot of friends. So, we would joke that
                                            there would be more of his friends at my wedding than my own. He was also
                                            very old-school, so it’s a safe bet that he would have expected all the
                                            traditions to be followed and done by the book.

                                            While it’s heartbreaking that he cannot be there to watch me walk down the
                                            aisle, I started penning a list of ways I could include his memory at my
                                            wedding.

                                            If you are in the same boat and are looking to honor a lost one—whether you
                                            want to do something big, or something subtle, here are a couple ideas I’ve

                                        <p class="blog-sub-text">Was there a signature piece of jewellery that your
                                            loved one was known to always wear? Or maybe something they wore at their

                                            wearing, include it on your wedding day, so you’ll feel like they’re right
                                            there with you.

                                            adding their favourite Gulab Jamun to the menu, or, you could go all out and
                                            make the entire days theme based on their favourite cuisine. Were they
                                            always partial to Italian food? Have live pizza and pasta counters at your

                                            I saw that my friend did something similar for his wedding, so I talked to
                                            him about it. He said:

                                            So, for my Sangeet, we had the bartender create a whiskey cocktail<br>

                                            for close relatives. Or in my family, we usually have the parents, and

                                            Leave a seat open, either on the mandap, or in the front row, and place a

                                        <p class="blog-sub-text">In lieu of gifts, have guests directly donate money or

                                            Or have them donate to an organisation you are passionate about in your

                                            There’s also a TON of leftover food after each wedding event. Instead of
                                            wasting it, have local organisations and temples that feed the poor or
                                            homeless, come and pick it up. However, there might be some restrictions in
                                            what food they are allowed to collect. So, don’t forget to consult the
                                            organisations while you’re planning the menus!

                                        <p class="blog-sub-text">

                                            If you want to do something more conspicuous, make a quick toast in front of
                                            your guests. Say a few words about your loved one—maybe advice they
                                            imparted, or how much they meant to you.

                                            <br> <br>

                                            It can be as simple as saying, “This song is for___” and play their
                                            favourite tune at your sangeet.

                                        </p>

                                        <p class="blog-sub-text">

                                            Go through old photos and see if you could recreate how their wedding was.
                                            Maybe incorporate the same flowers or wear the same colour saree they wore
                                            on their special day. <br>

                                            <br>

                                            It’s tough when someone that means so much to you is not around. Especially
                                            on what’s supposed to be one of the happiest days of your life. By including
                                            elements that remind you of them, it should feel like they are right there
                                            by your side.
